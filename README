flume-voldemort-plugin
======================

The flume-voldemort-plugin allows you to use Voldemort as a Flume sink.

First things first
------------------
1. You need to have 'ant' installed in your PC. If not, go to http://ant.apache.org and install it.


Getting Started with flume-voldemort-plugin
-------------------------------------------

1. Set FLUME_HOME environment variable first
    export FLUME_HOME=<path to where your Flume installation resides>

    from this point forward, I'll use FLUME_HOME to indicate the Flume installation path

2. Copy the flume-voldemort-plugin directory into FLUME_HOME/plugins/.  

3. Go to flume-voldemort-plugin directory and issue 'ant' command to build the flume-voldemort-plugin.jar
   If build succeeded, you can see the flume-voldemort-plugin.jar inside current directory.

4. Copy flume-voldemort-plugin.jar and all jar files inside the lib/ directory into FLUME_HOME/lib.
      After copying, make sure following jar files exist in the FLUME_HOME/lib directory
      - flume-voldemort-plugin.jar
      - voldemort-0.81.jar
      - log4j-1.2.15.jar
      - google-collect-1.0.jar

5. Go to FLUME_HOME/conf directory
    - Make a copy of  flume-site.xml.template file and rename the new file as flume-site.xml
    - Modify flume-site.xml to include:

    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>flume.plugin.classes</name>
        <value>voldemort.VoldemortSink</value>
        <description>Comma separated list of plugin classes</description>
      </property>
    </configuration>

6. Startup Flume master and nodes and verify that the plugin is detected by Flume
    cd $FLUME_HOME
    bin/flume master

    check for following line in the startup log of the Flume master

    2010-10-02 18:46:14,856 [main] INFO conf.SinkFactoryImpl: Found sink builder voldemortSink in voldemort.VoldemortSink

    If you cant see the above line in master's startup log, start redoing from step (2) :)  

    bin/flume node_nowatch

7. Congratulations! you are done with the installation.
